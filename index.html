        <p> A comfortable and relaxed meal could be a catalyst in achieving a better outcome one day at a time. 
          To ensure the same we've come up with this project wherein our website could be efficient in choosing menu, ordering food, drinks and effortless payment and accordingly the bill generated could be verified with a QR code scanner at the providers end and makes the entire food ordering process less time consuming.
          </p>
          <br/>
